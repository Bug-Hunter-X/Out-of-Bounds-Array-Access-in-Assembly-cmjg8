This repository contains an example of an out-of-bounds array access error in assembly language. The error occurs when the program attempts to access memory outside of the allocated space for an array. This can lead to program crashes, data corruption, or other unpredictable behavior. The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error by checking the array bounds before accessing the array elements.
