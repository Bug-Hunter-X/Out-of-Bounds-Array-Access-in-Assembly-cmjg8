mov eax, [ebx + 4*ecx] ; This line causes an access violation if ecx is out of bounds.

This is a common error in assembly language programming. It occurs when the program attempts to access memory outside of the allocated space for an array or variable. This can lead to program crashes, data corruption, or other unpredictable behavior.
